# Dialog & Quest

<h3>Backend for game development project "Dialog & Quest"</h3>

<h3>Dialog & Quest is a custom system for Unreal Engine to implement basic
  Dialogs, Quests and Scripts. Dialogs and Quests are imported as CSV files,
  while Scripts are executed from C++ file, so no need to use other scripting languages.
  This makes it easier to add scripts to game with only knowing C++.</h3>

<p>This is a remaster of original system first made in 2016.</p>

# API

<p>This section explains API calls. For mentioned classes please scroll down.</p>

**Project**<br>
***Returns CustomResponse with ProjectDTO as Object***
```
/api/project/getById/{databaseId}
/api/project/getByProjectId/{projectId}
```

# Structure

<h3>This section explains class structure to better understand how this API works.</h3>

## Global

#### GlobalService
<p>Global volatile service. This is used to check condition of multiple values at same time</p>

```
isTrue(boolean ... args)
    Returns true if all input booleans are true

isNull(Object ... args)
    Returns true if any of the provided arguments is null

notNull(Object ... args)
    Returns true if none of the provided objects is null

isBlank(String ... args)
    Returns true if any of the provided strings is blank

isEmpty(List ... args)
    Returns true if any of the provided arrays is empty
```

#### GUIDGenerator
<p>Custom GUID generator. By default generates random string of 16 symbols from 62 random symbols.</p>

```
GUIDGenerator does not need to be imported as it's volatile.
Functions are called with "GUIDGenerator.{function}".
variable definition DEFAULT_LENGTH = 16

generate()                      Calls generate(DEFAULT_LENGTH)

generate({int length})          Generates GUID with given length from 62 random symbols
```
